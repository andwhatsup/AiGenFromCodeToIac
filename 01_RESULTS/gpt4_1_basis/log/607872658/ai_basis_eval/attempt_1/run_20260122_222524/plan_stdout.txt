Terraform used the selected providers to generate the following execution
plan. Resource actions are indicated with the following symbols:
  + create

Terraform planned the following actions, but then encountered a problem:

  # random_id.bucket_suffix will be created
  + resource "random_id" "bucket_suffix" {
      + b64_std     = (known after apply)
      + b64_url     = (known after apply)
      + byte_length = 4
      + dec         = (known after apply)
      + hex         = (known after apply)
      + id          = (known after apply)
    }

Plan: 1 to add, 0 to change, 0 to destroy.
