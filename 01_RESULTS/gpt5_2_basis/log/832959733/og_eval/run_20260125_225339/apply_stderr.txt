Error: Failed to persist state to backend

The error shown above has prevented Terraform from writing the updated state
to the configured backend. To allow for recovery, the state has been written
to the file "errored.tfstate" in the current working directory.

Running "terraform apply" again at this point will create a forked state,
making it harder to recover.

To retry writing this state, use the following command:
    terraform state push errored.tfstate
