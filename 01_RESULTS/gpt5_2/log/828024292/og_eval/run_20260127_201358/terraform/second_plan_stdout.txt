Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.example must be replaced
-/+ resource "null_resource" "example" {
      ~ id       = "6973704074501702745" -> (known after apply)
      ~ triggers = { # forces replacement
          ~ "always_run" = "2026-01-27T19:14:27Z" -> (known after apply)
        }
    }
