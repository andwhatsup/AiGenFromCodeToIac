  "aws_architecture_description": "## Proposed high-level AWS architecture (safe placeholder)\n\nBecause the repository contents (languages/frameworks/dependencies) could not be inspected, the architecture below is a **lean, broadly applicable** AWS deployment pattern for a generic HTTP(S) “App Service” that may optionally use a database and object storage.\n\n### 1) Networking & edge\n- **VPC across 2 Availability Zones** for high availability.\n- **Public subnets** host internet-facing load balancers and NAT.\n- **Private application subnets** host the compute runtime (containers/VMs) with no direct inbound internet access.\n- **Private data subnets** host the database (if used), isolated from the app tier.\n- **Route 53** provides DNS for the application domain.\n- **ACM** issues TLS certificates.\n- **Application Load Balancer (ALB)** terminates TLS and routes HTTP(S) traffic to the application runtime.\n- Optional: **AWS WAF** in front of ALB for basic L7 protection (SQLi/XSS/bot rules) if the app is internet-facing.\n\n### 2) Application runtime (default recommendation: containers)\nGiven unknown tech, the most flexible default is containerization:\n- Package the “App Service” as a container image.\n- Store images in **Amazon ECR**.\n- Run the service on **Amazon ECS with Fargate** (no servers to manage).\n- Use an **ECS Service** spanning 2 AZs, registered to an **ALB Target Group**.\n- Configure **Auto Scaling** based on CPU/memory and/or ALB request count.\n\nIf later you discover the app is not container-friendly, you can swap the runtime to:\n- **EC2 Auto Scaling Group** behind the same ALB, or\n- **Elastic Beanstalk** (still ALB-based), or\n- **EKS** (only if you truly need Kubernetes).\n\n### 3) Data store (optional)\nBecause the database type is unknown, choose one of these based on what the app actually needs:\n- **Amazon RDS (PostgreSQL/MySQL)** for relational workloads.\n  - Multi-AZ enabled.\n  - Credentials stored in **AWS Secrets Manager**.\n- **Amazon DynamoDB** for key-value/document access patterns.\n\n(Do not provision both unless the application truly needs both.)\n\n### 4) Object storage (optional)\n- **Amazon S3** bucket(s) for uploads/artifacts/media.\n- If the app serves user downloads or static assets, optionally front S3 with **CloudFront**.\n- Use **S3 bucket policies** and **IAM roles** for least-privilege access from the app.\n\n### 5) Observability, security, and operations\n- **CloudWatch Logs** for application logs (ECS task logs).\n- **CloudWatch Metrics/Alarms** for ALB 5xx, latency, ECS CPU/memory, and (if used) RDS health.\n- **AWS CloudTrail** for account audit logging.\n- **AWS Config** (optional but recommended in regulated environments).\n- **KMS** keys for encryption at rest (S3, RDS, Secrets Manager).\n\n### 6) CI/CD (generic)\nBecause the repo’s build system is unknown, a safe AWS-native pipeline is:\n- **CodePipeline** orchestrates.\n- **CodeBuild** builds/tests and produces a container image.\n- Push image to **ECR**.\n- Deploy to **ECS** (rolling or blue/green via CodeDeploy if needed).\n\n---\n\n## Deployment flow (request path)\n1. User hits `https://app.example.com` (Route 53).\n2. Traffic terminates TLS at ALB (ACM cert).\n3. ALB forwards to ECS Fargate tasks in private subnets.\n4. App reads/writes to:\n   - RDS in private data subnets (if used), and/or\n   - S3 for object storage (if used).\n5. Logs/metrics go to CloudWatch; alarms notify operators.\n\n---\n\n## Key assumptions / what to confirm next\nTo refine this from “placeholder” to “accurate,” confirm:\n- Is the app containerized already (Dockerfile)?\n- Does it need a relational DB (Postgres/MySQL) vs NoSQL?\n- Any background jobs/queues (SQS), caching (ElastiCache), or websockets?\n- Expected traffic and availability requirements.\n",
