No changes. Your infrastructure matches the configuration.

Terraform has compared your real infrastructure against your configuration
and found no differences, so no changes are needed.

Warning: Argument is deprecated

  with aws_iam_role.iam_for_lambda,
  on deployment.tf line 90, in resource "aws_iam_role" "iam_for_lambda":
  90:   managed_policy_arns = [aws_iam_policy.lambda_permissions.arn]

managed_policy_arns is deprecated. Use the aws_iam_role_policy_attachment
resource instead. If Terraform should exclusively manage all managed policy
attachments (the current behavior of this argument), use the
aws_iam_role_policy_attachments_exclusive resource as well.
