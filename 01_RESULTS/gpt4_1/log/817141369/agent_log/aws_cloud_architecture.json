  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a modern, cloud-native web application stack designed for scalability, automation, and efficient static content delivery. The architecture leverages AWS managed services, Kubernetes orchestration, and CI/CD automation for robust deployment and operations.\n\n1. **Networking & Security**:\n   - All resources are deployed within a dedicated VPC, with public and private subnets across multiple Availability Zones for high availability.\n   - Security Groups and IAM roles are tightly scoped to follow the principle of least privilege.\n\n2. **Compute & Orchestration**:\n   - An AWS Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster orchestrates containerized workloads.\n   - The main web application is packaged as a Docker container (Nginx serving static content) and deployed via a Kubernetes Deployment (dinosaur-deployment).\n   - The application is exposed externally using a Kubernetes Service of type LoadBalancer, which provisions an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB) for secure, scalable ingress.\n\n3. **Static Content Hosting**:\n   - The \"Jump Game\" static web application is hosted on Amazon S3 with static website hosting enabled.\n   - Amazon CloudFront is used as a CDN to accelerate content delivery and provide HTTPS for the S3-hosted site.\n\n4. **CI/CD Automation**:\n   - Jenkins and GitHub Actions pipelines are configured to automate build, test, and deployment processes.\n   - Pipelines interact with EKS using IAM roles and Kubernetes RBAC for secure, automated deployments.\n\n5. **Infrastructure as Code**:\n   - Terraform is used to provision and manage all AWS resources, ensuring repeatability and version control of infrastructure.\n\n6. **Monitoring & Logging**:\n   - Amazon CloudWatch is used for monitoring EKS, ALB, and other AWS resources.\n   - AWS CloudTrail is enabled for auditing API activity.\n\nThis architecture is secure, scalable, and cost-effective, following AWS best practices for networking, compute, storage, and automation. It supports rapid development cycles and reliable, high-performance delivery of both the main static site and the Jump Game.",
