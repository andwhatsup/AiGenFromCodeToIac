  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a serverless Java application deployed as an AWS Lambda function that interacts with the Telegram Bot API. The architecture is designed for simplicity, scalability, and security, following AWS best practices for serverless deployments.\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n\n1. **AWS Lambda Function (Java):**\n   - The core compute resource, implemented in Java, is deployed as a Lambda function. It is triggered by scheduled events (if required) or invoked manually, and executes the business logic to interact with the Telegram Bot API.\n   - The Lambda function is built and packaged using Maven (`pom.xml`).\n\n2. **Environment Variables:**\n   - The Lambda function is configured with environment variables (`bot_token`, `chat_id`, `half_month_message`, `end_month_message`) for runtime configuration and secrets management.\n   - For enhanced security, sensitive values (like `bot_token`) should be stored in AWS Secrets Manager or AWS Systems Manager Parameter Store, and referenced by the Lambda function.\n\n3. **IAM Role for Lambda Execution:**\n   - An IAM role is created and assigned to the Lambda function, granting it permissions to write logs to CloudWatch and (optionally) read secrets from Secrets Manager or Parameter Store.\n\n4. **VPC (Optional):**\n   - If the Lambda function needs to access resources in a private subnet or requires outbound internet access through a NAT Gateway, it can be deployed within a VPC. For this use case (outbound HTTP to Telegram), Lambda can run outside a VPC for simplicity, unless further security or compliance requirements exist.\n\n5. **CloudWatch Logs:**\n   - Lambda logs are sent to Amazon CloudWatch Logs for monitoring, troubleshooting, and auditing.\n\n6. **(Optional) EventBridge Rule or CloudWatch Events:**\n   - If the Lambda function needs to run on a schedule (e.g., send messages at specific times), an EventBridge rule (formerly CloudWatch Events) can be configured to trigger the Lambda function on a cron schedule.\n\n**Security and Best Practices:**\n- Use least-privilege IAM policies for the Lambda execution role.\n- Store sensitive configuration in Secrets Manager or Parameter Store, not directly in environment variables.\n- Enable Lambda concurrency limits if needed to control costs and prevent abuse.\n- Monitor Lambda execution and errors via CloudWatch.\n\n**Scalability:**\n- AWS Lambda automatically scales with demand, requiring no manual intervention.\n- No server management is required, and costs are based on actual usage.",
