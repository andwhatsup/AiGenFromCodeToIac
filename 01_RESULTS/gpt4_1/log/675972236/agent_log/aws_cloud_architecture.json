  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a simple, serverless deployment of a Rust-based AWS Lambda function. The architecture is designed for minimalism, security, and scalability, following AWS best practices for serverless applications.\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n- **Developer Workstation:** The Rust code is developed, built, and packaged locally into a deployment artifact (`lambda.zip`).\n- **Artifact Storage:** The deployment artifact is uploaded to an S3 bucket, which serves as the source for Lambda deployments. This enables versioning, rollback, and CI/CD integration.\n- **AWS Lambda Function:** The core compute resource, running the Rust code using the `lambda_runtime` crate. The Lambda function is deployed from the S3 bucket artifact.\n- **IAM Roles and Policies:** Secure, least-privilege IAM roles are created for Lambda execution and S3 access.\n- **Networking:** By default, Lambda functions run in a secure AWS-managed VPC. If the function needs access to VPC resources (e.g., RDS, private APIs), a custom VPC, subnets, and security groups would be provisioned. For this minimal example, no custom VPC is required unless specified.\n- **Monitoring and Logging:** CloudWatch Logs are enabled for the Lambda function to capture logs and metrics for observability and troubleshooting.\n\n**Deployment Flow:**\n1. Developer builds and packages the Lambda function locally.\n2. The `lambda.zip` artifact is uploaded to an S3 bucket.\n3. The Lambda function is created/updated to use the artifact from S3.\n4. IAM roles ensure secure execution and access to required AWS resources.\n5. CloudWatch provides monitoring and logging for the Lambda function.\n\nThis architecture is lean, secure, and ready for extension (e.g., API Gateway, event triggers) as needed.",
