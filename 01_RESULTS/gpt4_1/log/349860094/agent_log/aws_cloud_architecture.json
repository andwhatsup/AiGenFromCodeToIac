  "aws_architecture_description": "Based on the analysis, the codebase is empty and does not contain any deployable components, services, or projects. Therefore, there is no application or infrastructure to deploy on AWS at this time. No AWS resources are required for this system, as there are no workloads, data stores, or networking needs to support. If future development adds deployable components, an AWS architecture can be proposed accordingly.",
