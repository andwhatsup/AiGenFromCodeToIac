  "aws_architecture_description": "The proposed AWS architecture is designed to securely and efficiently deploy a Rust-based Axum web application as a containerized service. The application will run on AWS ECS (Elastic Container Service) using Fargate for serverless container management, which eliminates the need to manage EC2 instances. The ECS service will be deployed within a dedicated VPC for network isolation and security. Public and private subnets will be used to separate internet-facing and internal resources. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) will route incoming HTTP(S) traffic to the ECS service, enabling scalable and highly available access to the web application. Security Groups will restrict network access to only necessary ports. IAM roles and policies will be provisioned to grant the ECS task permissions to write logs to AWS CloudWatch Logs, which will be used for centralized logging and monitoring. The architecture is designed for scalability, security, and observability, following AWS best practices for containerized workloads. No persistent storage or database resources are required based on the current codebase analysis.",
