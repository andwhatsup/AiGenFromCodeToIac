Error: Missing resource instance key

  on outputs.tf line 31, in output "route53_zone_id":
  31:   value = aws_route53_zone.main.id

Because aws_route53_zone.main has "count" set, its attributes must be
accessed on specific instances.

For example, to correlate with indices of a referring resource, use:
    aws_route53_zone.main[count.index]
