Terraform will perform the following actions:

  # null_resource.example must be replaced
-/+ resource "null_resource" "example" {
      ~ id       = "5486915750166587805" -> (known after apply)
      ~ triggers = { # forces replacement
          ~ "always_run" = "2025-12-22T20:38:24Z" -> (known after apply)
        }
    }
