  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a static documentation site deployment pipeline using MkDocs, Docker, AWS S3, and Terraform for infrastructure management. The architecture is designed for simplicity, security, and scalability, following AWS best practices for static site hosting and infrastructure-as-code.\n\n**Architecture Overview:**\n1. **Build Environment:**\n   - The MkDocs documentation site is built using Python and various MkDocs plugins. The build process is encapsulated in a Docker container to ensure consistent and reproducible builds across environments.\n\n2. **Artifact Storage and Hosting:**\n   - The output of the MkDocs build (static HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) is uploaded to an Amazon S3 bucket. This S3 bucket serves as the public hosting location for the documentation site.\n   - (Optional, but recommended) S3 static website hosting is enabled, and the bucket is configured for public read access (or restricted via CloudFront for enhanced security).\n\n3. **Infrastructure Provisioning:**\n   - Terraform is used to provision and manage AWS resources. Terraform state is stored remotely in a dedicated S3 bucket, with state locking and consistency ensured via DynamoDB (recommended best practice).\n\n4. **Security and Access Control:**\n   - IAM roles and policies are created to allow the build process (e.g., CI/CD pipeline or developer machines) to upload artifacts to the S3 bucket.\n   - IAM policies are also created to allow Terraform to manage AWS resources and store state securely.\n\n5. **Networking and Monitoring:**\n   - As this is a static site, no VPC or subnets are required for hosting. However, foundational resources such as CloudWatch for monitoring and logging access to S3 are recommended.\n   - (Optional) AWS CloudFront can be used as a CDN in front of the S3 bucket for improved performance, HTTPS support, and access control.\n\n**Deployment Flow:**\n- Developers or CI/CD pipeline trigger the MkDocs build in Docker.\n- The built site is uploaded to the S3 bucket.\n- Terraform manages the lifecycle of AWS resources, with state stored in a dedicated S3 bucket (and optionally locked with DynamoDB).\n\nThis architecture is lean, secure, and highly available, leveraging AWS managed services for static site hosting and infrastructure management.",
