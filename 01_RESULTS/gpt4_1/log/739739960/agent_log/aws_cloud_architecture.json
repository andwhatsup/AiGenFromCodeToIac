  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a static web application built with JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, using Parcel, TailwindCSS, and PostCSS. The application is deployed as a static bundle and does not require any backend compute or database resources. The optimal AWS architecture for this use case leverages Amazon S3 for static web hosting, Amazon CloudFront as a CDN for global low-latency access and HTTPS support, and AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) for SSL/TLS certificates. Route 53 can be used for custom domain management. IAM roles and policies are required for secure access and deployment automation. Logging and monitoring can be enabled via S3 access logs and CloudFront logs. This architecture is secure, scalable, cost-effective, and follows AWS best practices for static site hosting.",
