  "aws_architecture_description": "Based on the analysis, the codebase is empty and contains no deployable components, services, or dependencies. Therefore, there is no application or system to deploy on AWS at this time. As a result, no AWS architecture is required, and no AWS resources need to be provisioned. If future code or components are added, an appropriate AWS architecture can be designed to support those requirements.",
