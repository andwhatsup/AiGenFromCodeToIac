  "aws_architecture_description": "This system is a modern static web application deployed on AWS using Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) for container orchestration, with infrastructure as code managed by Terraform and CI/CD handled by Jenkins and GitHub Actions. The application is a static site (HTML, JS, CSS) served by Nginx in a Docker container. The deployment pipeline includes building Docker images, pushing them to a container registry (DockerHub or GHCR), and deploying to EKS. The application is exposed to the internet via an AWS Application Load Balancer (ALB), with all resources securely isolated within a VPC. The architecture follows AWS best practices for security, scalability, and automation, leveraging managed services where possible. Monitoring, logging, and IAM roles are included for operational excellence and least-privilege access control.",
