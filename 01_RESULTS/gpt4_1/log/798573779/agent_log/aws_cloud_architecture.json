  "aws_architecture_description": "This AWS architecture is designed for a static HTML web application served by Nginx, containerized with Docker, and deployed using a fully managed CI/CD pipeline on AWS. The workflow is as follows:\n\n1. Developers push code to AWS CodeCommit, which acts as the source code repository.\n2. A commit to CodeCommit triggers AWS CodePipeline, which orchestrates the build and deployment process.\n3. AWS CodeBuild executes the build process as defined in buildspec.yml, builds the Docker image (Nginx + HTML), and pushes the image to Amazon ECR (Elastic Container Registry).\n4. CodeBuild notifies AWS CodeDeploy, and CodePipeline triggers CodeDeploy to start the deployment.\n5. AWS CodeDeploy deploys the new Docker image to an ECS Fargate service.\n6. The ECS Fargate service registers its running tasks with a Target Group.\n7. An Application Load Balancer (ALB) routes incoming HTTP/HTTPS traffic to the Target Group, which forwards requests to the ECS Fargate tasks running the Nginx container.\n8. IAM roles and policies are used to securely manage permissions for CodeBuild, CodePipeline, CodeDeploy, ECS, and other AWS services.\n9. Foundational AWS resources such as VPC, subnets, security groups, and CloudWatch for monitoring/logging are included to ensure a secure, scalable, and observable environment.\n\nThis architecture follows AWS best practices for containerized web applications, providing automation, scalability, and security.",
