Invalid value for "path" parameter: no file exists at
"../source/.security/my-net-keypair.id_rsa.pub"; this function works only
with files that are distributed as part of the configuration source code, so
if this file will be created by a resource in this configuration you must
instead obtain this result from an attribute of that resource.
